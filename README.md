## Introduction
Given the difficulty of manually annotating motion in video, the current best motion estimation methods are trained with synthetic data, 
and therefore struggle somewhat due to a train/test gap. Self-supervised methods hold the promise of training directly on real video, 
but typically perform worse. These include methods trained with warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with smoothness terms, 
and methods that encourage cycle-consistency in the estimates (i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking forwards). 
In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art supervised models with self-supervised training. 
We find that when the initialization is supervised weights, most existing self-supervision techniques actually make performance worse instead of better, 
which suggests that the benefit of seeing the new data is overshadowed by the noise in the training signal. Focusing on obtaining a 
"clean" training signal from real-world unlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two distinct stages. 
In the first stage, we use the pre-trained model to estimate motion in a video, and then select the subset of motion estimates which we can verify with cycle-consistency. 
This produces a sparse but accurate pseudo-labelling of the video. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model to reproduce these outputs, 
while also applying augmentations on the input. We complement this boot-strapping method with simple techniques that densify and re-balance the pseudo-labels, 
ensuring that we do not merely train on "easy" tracks. We show that our method yields reliable gains over fully-supervised methods in real videos, 
for both short-term (flow-based) and long-range (multi-frame) pixel tracking.
